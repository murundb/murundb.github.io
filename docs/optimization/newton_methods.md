## General Descent Methods

The basic paradigm of descent methods is as follows:

1. Choose an initial solution $\mathbf{x}^0$.
2. Choose a descent direction $\mathbf{d}^0$
3. Choose a step size $\alpha_0$
4. Update the solution $\mathbf{x}^1 = \mathbf{x}^0 + \alpha_0 \mathbf{d}^0$
5. If a stopping criteria is met, stop; else re-iterate with current solution.
