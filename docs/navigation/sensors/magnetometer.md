## Magnetic Inclination and Declination

Magnetic north is located in northern Canada at Ellesmere Island. 
**Magnetic inclination** is the angle between the earth's surface and the magnetic field lines (angle made by compass needle when the compass
is held in a vertical orientation). The inclination is positive when the field is pointing downward, into the Earth.

**Magnetic declination** is the angle between the 
magnetic north of the compass and the true north (geographic north). The declination is positive when the magnetic north polse is east of true north.
