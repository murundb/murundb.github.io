There are five types of time of flight (TOF) based ranging measurements from which a position solution may be determined:

1. Passive ranging or time of arrival (TOA).
2. Time difference of arrival (TDOA) across transmitters or hyperbolic ranging.
3. Differential ranging or TDOA across receivers.
4. Double-differenced ranging across transmitters and receivers.
5. Two-way ranging.
