## Notation

**Scalars** are represented as italic, e.g., $b$.

**Vectors** are represented as bold lower case, e.g., $\mathbf{x}$. The scalar components of a vector are denoted by the 
corresponding italic symbol with a single numerical index
, i.e., given $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, the components are $\mathbf{x} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
x_1 & x_2& \cdots & x_n 
\end{array}
\right]^T$.

**Matrices** are represented as bold upper case, e.g., transformation matrix using homogenous coordinates $\mathbf{T}$. A matrix denoted as $R^{\beta}_{\alpha}$ denotes a rotation matrix from frame $F_\alpha$ to frame $F_\beta$. When a matrix is used to represent an attitude, it is more common to use the upper index to represent the reference frame and the lower
index to represent the object frame. 

**Frames** are represented as letter $F$ with subscript as frame name. All coordinate frames will be right-handed.

## Nomenclature

### Magnetic Inclination and Declination

Magnetic north is located in northern Canada at Ellesmere Island. 
**Magnetic inclination** is the angle between the earth's surface and the magnetic field lines (angle made by compass needle when the compass
is held in a vertical orientation). The inclination is positive when the field is pointing downward, into the Earth.

**Magnetic declination** is the angle between the 
magnetic north of the compass and the true north (geographic north). The declination is positive when the magnetic north polse is east of true north.
