| Term  | Description |
| ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| Conditioning | Perturbation behavior of a mathematical problem |
| Well-conditioned | All small perturbations of $\mathbf{x}$ lead to only small changes in $f(\mathbf{x})$ |
| Ill-conditioned | $Small perturbation of $\mathbf{x}$ leads to a large change in $f(\mathbf{x})$$ |
| Stability | Perturbation behavior of an algorithm used to solve that problem on a computer |
