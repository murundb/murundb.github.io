# Infinite Impuse Response Filters

## Overview

Class of digital filters that are not guaranteed to be stable and always have nonlinear phase response. IIR filters have a much steeper transition region roll-off (superior performance) than digital FIR filters.

Where FIR filter output samples depend only on past input samples, each IIR filter output sample depends on previous input samples and previous filter output samples.
