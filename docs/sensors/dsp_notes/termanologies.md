| Lowpass signal | Signals that have their frequency components centered around the zero frequency |
| IIR | Infinite impulse response |
| FIR | Finite impulse response |
| Signal-to-noise ratio | $\text{SNR} = \frac{\mu}{\sigma}$. Better data means a higher value for the SNR and a lower value for the CV. For example, signal with a CV of 2% has an SNR of 50.
| Coefficient of variation (CV) | $\text{CV} = \frac{\mu}{\sigma} \times 100$ |
| Stationary signal | A signal whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, do no change over time |
