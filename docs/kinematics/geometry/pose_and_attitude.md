**Attitude** describes the orientation of the axes of one coordinate frame with respect to those of another. 
For example, let $F_\alpha$ be a frame attached to an object of interest and let $F_\beta$ be the reference frame.
Then we can represent the attitude of the object by matrix $\mathbf{R}^{\beta}_{\alpha}$ (some also use $\mathbf{R}^{\alpha}_{\beta}$), which
represents the transformation from frame $F_\alpha$ to frame $F_\beta$. 


Vehicles typically have six degrees of freedom: three in translation and three in rotation. This six-degree-of-freedom geometric configuration is known
as the **pose** of the vehicle.
