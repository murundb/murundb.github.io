## Perturbation via Euler Angles

The problem with perturbing rotations is that most of the representations involve constraints and thus are not easily perturbed via [Perturbation Methods](/math/perturbation_methods/), where $\delta \mathbf{x}$ is not constrained in any way. Euler angles are exceptions since it contains three parameters than can be varied independently. 

Consider perturbing $\mathbf{R} (\boldsymbol{\theta}) \mathbf{v}$ with respect to Euler angles $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, where $\mathbf{v} is an arbitrary constant vector.  Let $\bar{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = (\bar{\theta}_1, \bar{\theta}_2, \bar{\theta}_3)$ and $\delta \boldsymbol{\theta} = (\delta \theta_1, \delta \theta_2, \delta \theta_3)$. THen we have:
