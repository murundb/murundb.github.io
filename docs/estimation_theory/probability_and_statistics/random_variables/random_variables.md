# Random Variable

## Definition

A **random variable** (RV) is a variable whose numerical value is determined by the outcome of a random experiment. Thus, a random variable is a mapping from the sample space of an experiment, $S$, to a set of real numbers.

The **probability distribution** of a random variable $X$ is a table (assignment, rule, formula) that assigns probabilities to realizations of $X$, or sets of realizations.

RVs can be either discrete or continuous.
